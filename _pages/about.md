I am an associate professor at College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering, Hunan University, since November 2024, specializing in dispersed multiphase turbulence. My research focuses on non-spherical particle dynamics, particle-laden turbulent flows, and the fabrication theory of nano-fibers/particles via turbulence. I have published over 20 articles in prestigious journals, including Sci. Adv., JFM, IJMF, and POF, etc.

I earned my PhD from Tsinghua University under the supervision of [Prof. Lihao Zhao (赵立豪)](https://www.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/hyen/info/1162/1212.htm) at [Turbulence Research Laboratory](http://trl.hy.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), after which I continued my research as a postdoctoral researcher at Tsinghua University from July 2022 to October 2024.

During my doctoral studies, I developed PARTURB, a Fortran program for simulating particle-laden turbulent flows, achieving direct numerical simulations of particle-laden turbulent channel flow with friction Reynolds numbers up to 2000. As a postdoc, I created [PhyStar (星耀)](https://phystar-group.github.io/), a comprehensive numerical simulation platform for multi-physics research, integrating various solvers for wall turbulence, particle-laden flows, and fluid-solid interactions. This platform will be collaboratively developed by Tsinghua University and Hunan University, where I will serve as the principal investigator.

 **Welcome to join us in conducting impactful and exciting research together!**

<!-- At present, the code is used by research groups of many units such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, and Xi'an Jiaotong University, supporting more than 10 graduate student projects. During my postdoctoral period, I spontaneously presided over the PhyStar (Xingyao) multi-physics field scientific research platform project (C++ language), which has integrated multiple solution modules and applications such as wall turbulence, particle two-phase flow, and fluid-solid coupling. In the future, the platform will be jointly maintained by the Tsinghua and Huda teams (I am the person in charge, and 90% of the code is written by me line by line). At present, the platform has the world's leading direct numerical simulation capabilities for extreme particle turbulence two-phase flows, and will carry out research on cutting-edge scientific issues in the future. Welcome to join us and carry out interesting and influential work together. -->

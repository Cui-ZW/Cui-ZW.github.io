	abstract = {The rotational dynamics of finite-sized ellipsoidal particles with different aspect ratios around their fixed mass centers in shear flows have been investigated by direct numerical simulations. Particles are fully resolved by a revised immersed boundary projection method, and their rotational motion is governed by Euler’s equation which is calculated in the particle-fixed frame. The particle Reynolds number varies from 10 to 300 based on the longest axis of the particle. The steady states of the prolate and oblate spheroids in uniform flow, linear shear flow with the moving top wall and fixed bottom wall, and wall-bounded turbulence are analyzed. It is observed that the longest particle axes are perpendicular to or have a large angle with the local flow direction in the flow-gradient plane, which leads to a large drag force. A linear stability analysis on the rotational motion of a finite-sized particle in uniform flow is also carried out for supporting this finding. In the linear shear flow, the influence of fluid inertia and fluid shear on the inclined angle is examined in detail. In wall-bounded turbulence, it is found that the particles in the buffer region and the outside of the boundary layer behave similarly in the mean sense as in the linear shear flow and uniform flow, respectively. The present results with intermediate to large particle Reynolds numbers can be regarded as a starting point to understand the dynamics of heavy finite-sized particles in viscous flows.},

	abstract = {, In homogeneous isotropic turbulence, slender rods are known to align with the Lagrangian stretching direction. However, how the degree of alignment depends on the aspect ratio of the rod is not understood. Moreover, particle-laden flows are often anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Therefore we study the alignment of rods with the Lagrangian stretching direction in a channel flow, which is approximately homogeneous and isotropic near the centre but inhomogeneous and anisotropic near the walls. Our main question is how the distribution of relative angles between a rod and the Lagrangian stretching direction depends on the aspect ratio of the rod and upon the distance of the rod from the channel wall. We find that this distribution exhibits two regimes: a plateau at small angles corresponding to random uncorrelated motion, and power-law tails due to large excursions. We find that slender rods near the channel centre align better with the Lagrangian stretching direction compared with those near the channel wall. These observations are explained in terms of simple statistical models based on Jeffery's equation, qualitatively near the channel centre and quantitatively near the channel wall. Lastly we discuss the consequences of our results for the distribution of relative angles between the orientations of nearby rods (Zhao et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, vol. 4, 2019, 054602).},

These regions are different from those based on the conventional Reynolds-averaging view. The structure-dominant region, for instance, extends from about 3 to 60 wall units from the channel wall. Unlike the prevailing view that preferential alignment of fibers and disks are more common in the viscous sublayer than in the buffer layer, where the turbulence intensity reaches its maximum, the conditional ensemble-averaged approach revealed that fibers and disks align preferentially in the structure-dominant region. The particles moreover align differently in sweep and ejection events. The physical alignment mechanism we proposed may also be carried over to polymer- and fiber-induced drag reduction in wall-turbulence.},

Direct numerical simulations of particle-laden turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds number ReτReτRe\_{\textbackslash}tau from 600600600 to 200020002000 have been performed to examine the near-wall particle streaks. Different from the well-observed small-scale particle streaks in near-wall turbulence of low ReτReτRe\_{\textbackslash}tau, the present results show large-scale particle streaks through the computational domain formed for relatively high-inertia particles at high ReτReτRe\_{\textbackslash}tau. Transferred by large-scale sweep and ejection events (Q−Q−Q{\textasciicircum}-), these high-inertia particles preferentially accumulate in near-wall regions beneath the large-scale low-speed flow streaks observed in the logarithmic region. The corresponding Stokes numbers are associated with the lifetime of large-scale Q−Q−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures, which increases as the Reynolds number grows. The small-scale particle streaks with a typical Stokes number Stν≈30Stν≈30St\_{\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}approx 30 are mainly driven by the Q−Q−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures in the buffer layer, whose lifetime is approximately 303030 in viscous time unit. Therefore, we propose a new structure-based Stokes number normalized by the lifetime of Q−Q−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures of different scales. The relevant flow scales that control the formation of the large-scale particle streaks are parameterized by the structure-based Stokes number. The small-scale (large-scale) particle streaks are most prominent when the buffer-layer (large-scale) structure-based Stokes number approaches unity. The present findings reveal that formation of near-wall particle streaks is governed by the Q−Q−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures of different scales, and the particles with different inertia respond efficiently to the Q−Q−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures of corresponding scales with respect to the particle translational motion.},

We consider the torque induced by fluid inertia on such swimmers, and we discover that they spontaneously swim in the direction opposite to gravity. We analyze the equilibrium orientation of swimmers in quiescent fluid and the mean orientation in turbulent flows using direct numerical simulations. Similar to well-known gyrotaxis mechanisms, the effect of fluid inertial torque can be quantified by an effective reorientation timescale. We show that the orientation of swimmers strongly depends on the reorientation timescale, and swimmers exhibit strong preferential alignment in an upward direction when the timescale is of the same order of the Kolmogorov timescale. Our findings suggest that the fluid inertial torque is a different mechanism of gyrotaxis that stabilizes the upward orientation of microswimmers such as plankton.},

This observation is further investigated in the current study to uncover the mechanism of particle alignment behavior in different regions of channel flows at Reτ≈180 and 1000. Meanwhile, by using the probability distributions of the sign of the discriminant of the linear term in the Jeffery equation, we find that the turbulent channel flow can be distinctly divided into strong and weak shape-dependent regions. In the weak shape-dependent region, the slender (flat) particles have extraordinarily similar alignments with the directions of fluid Lagrangian stretching (compression). However, in the strong shape-dependent region, the alignments of these inertialess particles are sensitive to the particles shape, especially with the particle positions approaching the wall. The ranges of these shape-dependent regions rely on the Reynolds number, but the probability distributions of the sign of the discriminant of the linear term in the Jeffery equation are a useful tool to distinguish these shape-dependent regions in the wall turbulence regardless of the Reynolds number.},

The compressibility effect is considered in the particle dynamic model for the first time in the study of compressible particle-laden wall turbulence. We find that in both incompressible and compressible flow, gravity weakens the wall-normal and spanwise fluctuations of particle velocities as the Stokes number increases. However, compared to the incompressible flow case, the compressible effect amplifies the mean velocity, fluctuations of velocity, and slip velocity of particle in the streamwise direction. The wall-normal and spanwise fluctuations of particle velocities are augmented by the compressible effect in the channel core region. Moreover, in the core region, the effect of fluid compressibility on the wall-normal and spanwise fluctuations of particle velocities attenuates as the Stokes number increases, indicating a competition between the compressible effect and the particle inertia effect. We, furthermore, conduct the quadrant analysis of the local fluctuation velocities of fluid at particle positions and observe preferential distributions in the second and the fourth quadrants at y+ = 12.5–13.5. For compressible TVC flows, the pattern of probability distributions is more elongated, and the percentage is slightly higher in the second and fourth quadrants than that of incompressible flows. This observation implies that more particles locate in the ejection and sweep events in compressible flows than that in incompressible flows, which is anticipated to influence the particle wall-normal transport.},

	abstract = {, Rotation and orientation of non-spherical particles in a fluid flow depend on the hydrodynamic torque they experience. However, little is known about the effect of the fluid inertial torque on the dynamics of tiny inertial spheroids in turbulent channel flows, as only Jeffery torque has been considered in previous studies by point-particle direct numerical simulations. In this study, we investigate the rotation and orientation of tiny spheroids with both fluid inertial torque and Jeffery torque in a turbulent channel flow. By comparing with the case in the absence of fluid inertial torque, we find that the rotational and orientational dynamics of spheroids is significantly affected by the fluid inertial torque when the Stokes number, which is non-dimensionalized by fluid viscous time scale, is larger than the critical value Stc≈2Stc≈2St\_c{\textbackslash}approx 2, indicating that the fluid inertial torque is non-negligible for most particle cases considered in earlier studies. In contrast to the earlier findings considering only Jeffery torque (Challabotla et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol. 776, 2015, p. R2), we find that prolate (oblate) spheroids with a large Stokes number tend to tumble (spin) in the streamwise–wall-normal plane in a thinner region near the wall due to the presence of the fluid inertial torque. Approaching the channel centre, the flow shear gradually vanishes, but the velocity difference between local fluid and particles is still pronounced and increasing as particle inertia grows. As a result, in the core region, fluid inertial torque is dominant and drives the particles to align with its broad side normal to the streamwise direction rather than a random orientation observed in earlier studies without fluid inertial torque. Meanwhile, the presence of fluid inertial torque enhances the tumbling rates of spheroids in the core region. In addition, the effect of fluid inertial force on the dynamics of spheroids is also examined in this study, but the results indicate the effect of fluid inertial force is weak. Our findings imply the importance of fluid inertial torque in modelling the dynamics of inertial non-spherical particles in turbulent channel flows.},

	abstract = {The angular dynamics of tiny spheroidal particles in shear flows have been widely investigated, but most of the studies mainly focus on the effect of strong shear, while the combined effect of both shear and slip velocity at the center of the particle has been less considered. Actually, the fluid inertial torque induced by the slip velocity between particle and fluid plays a significant role in spheroid angular dynamics. However, it is difficult to investigate these dynamics theoretically until the analytical expression of the fluid inertial torque at a small Reynolds number was derived by Dabade et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 778, 133–188 (2015)]. In this study, the effect of the fluid inertial torque on the particle rotations is considered in a linear shear flow with a small streamwise slip velocity at the center of the particle. We find that as the fluid inertial torque dominates, the prolate spheroids tend to logroll while oblate ones have a tendency to tumble or align to a direction with a relative angle to the streamwise direction. These results are opposite to the earlier results in the absence of the fluid inertial torque. Different ultimate rotation modes of spheroids are dependent on the relative importance between the fluid inertial torque and the particle inertia, as well as the initial orientations. This reflects a non-trivial effect of fluid inertial torque on the angular dynamics of inertial spheroidal particles.},

	abstract = {Heat transfer of settling particles in homogeneous isotropic turbulence is investigated in one-way coupled Eulerian–Lagrangian direct numerical simulations. In the absence of gravity, our observations highlight that there was a correlation between particles concentration and temperature fronts, which are characterized by high-temperature gradients. The particle clustering is mainly influenced by the preferential concentration and the non-local effect, the latter being the memory of their interaction with the flow along their trajectories. Nevertheless, gravity significantly affects the clustering of particles, which further influence the heat transfer of particles with the fluid. We find that the heat transfer of particles is intricately related to particle dynamic inertia and thermal inertia, which can be quantified by the particle Stokes number St and particle thermal Stokes number Stθ, respectively. In this study, we observe that the variance of particle temperature rate of change is independent of Stθ at small thermal inertia but inversely proportional to Stθ2 for large thermal inertia. In the presence of gravity, the variance converges to Stθ−1 for particles with negligible thermal inertia. Our findings reveal that the second-order structure function of the particle temperature, indicating the enhancement of Lagrangian scalar intermittency, adheres to a power-law behavior with limited thermal inertial particles in the dissipation region, denoted as r2. However, as Stθ increases, the power law of the structure function of the particle temperature is disrupted leading to ‘thermal caustics’. The present findings of the heat transfer behavior of settling particles advance the understanding of gravity effect, and are valuable for the modeling of heat transfer in particle-laden turbulent flows.},

	abstract = {Clustering of plankton plays a vital role in several biological activities, including feeding, predation, and mating. Gyrotaxis is one of the mechanisms that induces clustering. A recent study (Candelier et al., 2022) reported a fluid inertial torque acting on a spherical microswimmer, which has the same effect as a gyrotactic torque. In this study, we model plankton cells as microswimmers that are subject to gravitational sedimentation as well as a fluid inertial torque. We use direct numerical simulations to obtain the trajectories of swimmers in homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We also investigate swimmers' clustering using Voronoï analysis. Our findings indicate that fluid inertial torque leads to notable clustering, with its intensity depending on the swimming and settling speeds of swimmers. Using Voronoï analysis, we demonstrate that swimmers preferentially sample downwelling regions where clustering is more prevalent.},

	abstract = {The alignment of elongated fibers and thin disks is known to be significantly  influenced by the presence of fluid coherent structures in near-wall turbulence                     (Cui et al. 2021). However, this earlier study is confined to the spheroids with                     infinitely large or small aspect ratio, and the shape effect of finite aspect                     ratio on the alignment is not considered. The current study investigates the                     shape-dependent alignment of inertialess spheroids in structure-dominated                     regions of channel flow. With utilizing an ensemble-averaged approach for                     identifying the structure-dominated regions, we analyze the eigensystem of the                     linear term matrix in the Jeffery equation, which is governed by both particle                     shape and local fluid velocity gradients. In contrast to earlier conventional                     analysis based on local vorticity and strain rate, our findings demonstrate that                     the eigensystem of the Jeffery equation offers a convenient, effective, and                     universal framework for predicting the alignment behavior of inertialess                     spheroids in turbulent flows. By leveraging the eigensystem of the Jeffery                     equation, we uncover a diverse effect of fluid coherent structures on spheroid                     alignment with different particle shapes. Furthermore, we provide explanations                     for both shape-independent alignments observed in vortical-core regions and                     shape-dependent alignments around near-wall streamwise vortices.},
